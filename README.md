# C++ STL Complete Guide

Welcome to the C++ STL Complete Guide repository! This repository aims to provide a comprehensive reference and guide to the C++ Standard Template Library (STL), covering algorithms, iterators, containers, and functors.

### Kindly ignore the .exe extension files as it is the executable file for each program that is provided in the repo.

## Features

- Detailed explanations and examples for each STL component.
- Code snippets demonstrating usage of algorithms, iterators, containers, and functors.
- Practical tips and best practices for efficient STL usage.
- Clear and concise explanations suitable for both beginners and advanced users.

## Contents

- **Algorithms**: Covers sorting, searching, manipulating sequences, and more.
- **Iterators**: Different types of iterators and their usage patterns.
- **Containers**: Details on various container types like vectors, lists, maps, and sets.
- **Functors**: Explanation of function objects and their role in STL algorithms.

## Usage

Clone the repository and explore the directories corresponding to each component of the STL. Each directory contains example code.
